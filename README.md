This project is in interest of MIPT students at ERCAFE, using B-spline theory and its practical usage.

Feel free to check our article on ResearchGate: [B-spline Approximation of Discrete Datasets. High Degree Splines.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345310511_B-spline_Approximation_of_Discrete_Datasets_High_Degree_Splines)

Examples were taken from here: https://github.com/chen0040/cpp-spline <br/>
